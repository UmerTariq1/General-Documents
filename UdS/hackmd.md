### Before You Land üõ´
<details>
<summary>Few tips before you come here </summary>

* Start learning German as soon as possible. While it possible to **survive** without, it'll make your life much much easier if you can speak some of it. Not only this, but it'll help you in getting more jobs and B1 Level is a requirement when applying for P.R later anyways. Some useful platforms to learn german are [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com) and [Busuu](http://busuu.com).
<br>
* Start looking for accomodations as soon as you can, preferably around 6 months before.<br><br>
* Please delete all torrent softwares and everything related to it from your computers(More details in the [General Tips](#General-tips) section)

### Living in Saarbr√ºcken üåÜ
![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-14_March_24-blue)

<details>
<summary>Get to know Saarbrucken </summary>
        
Saarbrucken(SB) is nice small city in Germany near France and Luxemburg. Its the capital of Saarland and majority of the population here is young. There are many Turkish people here so the city is generally Muslim-friendly and halal options are abundant.The university is fairly good but your experience will vary from course to course.
There are 2 main areas of Saarbrucken that you should know about. Dudweiler and SB City Center. SB city center as the name suggests is the center of the city. Dudweiler is a town in the outskirts of Saarbrucken. University is in the middle of SB city center and Dudweiler. Most of the students live in these 2 areas. Both are around 15-20 min from the university. You can find more details about accomodation in its own section.
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Get to know Saarbrucken through map </summary>

Below is the link to 2 custom maps with all the important locations marked. I have added the location of all the shops, dorms, main bus stops, masjids and etc on **[here](https://bit.ly/3OzxaFM)**. So, refer to it for all relevant queries.

The other map has the name of the areas marked and which area is famous for what. so refer to that map **[here](https://bit.ly/3w1Mgxm)**.
</details>

<details> <summary>How to reach Saarbrucken? </summary>

Suggested airport is Frankfrut. Frankfurt is around 3 hours away from SB by train. Airport and big train stations usually have free wifi. connect to them. Check [https://www.bahn.de](https://www.bahn.de) (DB : Deutsch Bahn / German railway) for train connections. There is an RE which comes directly from Frankfurt to Saarbrucken (SB) every 2 hours. make that your priority. Ask someone who is already in Saarbrucken if they can come pick you up from SB train station and can take you to your home. That way you dont have to worry about the busses here. 
There are other options of reaching Saarbrucken as well. For example coming to any other city in Germany and then coming to SB via train. Or landing at Paris and then taking flixbux to SB. Check your options, Take opinions, decide for yourself.
<br>
Note: You can enter Germany through any other European country. To quote the visa office: 
> National Visa holders  enjoy the same right to free movement as national residence permit holders.

<summary>What to bring when coming for the first time </summary>

![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-10_Feb_24-blue)
Even though it varies from person to person what kind of things they want to bring and how much weight the airline they are using allows. [Here is a list that we have created to help you guide in right direction in general](https://github.com/UmerTariq1/General-Documents/blob/main/UdS/PSA%20-%20what%20to%20bring%20list.pdf).

</details>

<details> 
<summary>Monthly income and expense</summary>

![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-16_July_24-blue)
Income depends on the number of hours you are working per week.
The average rate for per hour is around 13 to 15 euros. So, if you work for 16 hours per week, you will earn around 900 euros per month.
    
Expenses depends on a lot of factors. But you can get a general idea using this [website](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/in/Saarbrucken)

<summary>Deutschland Ticket and how to register/unregister for it ? </summary>

![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-23_October_24-blue)
The Deutschlandticket often shorted to the D-Ticket, also known as the 49-Euro-Ticket, is a subscription based public transport ticket for all **local** public transport, valid in the whole of Germany, that costs 49 euros per month for non students, and 26 euros for students. 
    
From winter semester 2024, the D-ticket is now included within the semester fees so now you dont have to pay separately.

Important: You cannot take any ICE / IC / EC trains. These are the names of the trains and when you use DB website you will figure it out. Chose the option local transport in db app and it will show you only the transport options that you can take with d ticket.
    
</details>

<details>
<summary>Applying for city registeration </summary>
Do below steps at 8am as there are more appointments available at that time. At 8am you can find an appointment within a few days while if you try at other times, you might not find any appointment for a month.
    
[**This link**](https://bit.ly/3OAbp8U) brings you to the page for making an appointment. It is in German only and a bit complicated, but we will try to run you through it (yuou can also use the web based translator to translate the page). Follow the below steps:

1) Under "Auswahl der Funktionseinheit" it says "**B√úRGERAMT**", that's the office you need to go to, so you have to select that.
2) Here you have to choose what you need to do during your appointment. For getting registered in Saarbr√ºcken, you need to select "**Meldeangelegenheiten**". This opens a bunch of options, where you have to select how many of each options you need to use. In your case, I believe you need to select the "+" symbol at "**Wohnsitzanmeldung Zuzug aus dem Ausland**" (for registering you at the place you are staying after moving here from abroad) and then press "**WEITER**" at the end of the page. You then get an overview of what you have selected and what you need to bring (your passport, a document you get from your landlord that verifies that you live at that place, and something that identifies you as a person, such as a birth or wedding certificate, and I believe they need to see the original document of that stuff for some reason. Then, you press "**OK**" at the end of the page.
3) Now you need to choose where you want to go to this office. There is a map on that page that shows you where each office is located, so you can choose whatever is closest to you, or just choose whichever has any open time slots. Then you can select a time slot for this office.
4) Enter your personal information. Your first name at "Vorname", last name at "Nachname", email at, well, "E-Mail" and once again at "E-Mail - Wiederholung", then finally your phone number at "Telefonnummer". Then you need to check the box that this data can be used to create an appointment, after which you can press "**TERMIN RESERVIEREN**" at the end of the page.

<details>
<summary>Applying for residence permit </summary>
If you have 6 months visa then apply for the residence permit in your 2nd or 3rd month. Email the university welcome centre to process your application, it gets done faster this way. Usually, Permit is given for 2 years but in the end, it depends on your Visa Officer (VO). 
If you want to apply yourself then call the VO right at the starting time of the office (8am). Otherwise they dont usually pick up the call.
    
    
Detailed information in case you want to apply through welcome center:
General rule of thumb

Goto welcome center as last resort :
1. your visa has already expired and you still haven‚Äôt got any appointment
2. ‚Å†your visa is about to expire and you want to travel
3. ‚Å†no ones is replying you from auslanderbehorde
4. having said the above things, sometimes welcome center does help getting you appointment even if you dont have any of those above problems. Depends on luck. Write email (welcome@uni-saarland.de) and ask about the procedure for visa extension or if they can request residence permit isssuence on your behalf. 
for all other cases you‚Äôll get an visa appointment letter when your visa is expiring this is for all the first timers and also for renewing.
        

write to general email address of auslanderbehorde when its your turn they‚Äôll assign you a VO

Send email to 3 to 4 people. And keep zab in CC (General contact : zab@lava.saarland.de)
Email template :
    Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this email finds you well.
I, <first_name> <last_name>, a master's student at the Saarland University, kindly request you to provide me with an appointment slot for the residence permit - visa extension.
The following documents have been attached alongside (in-order):
Passport (Identity/Front and Data/Back Page)
Current Student Visa (valid till dd.mm.yyyy)
Meldebest√§tigung
Immatrikulationsbescheinigung
Health Insurance Confirmation
Blocked Account Confirmation
    
Thank you,
Regards,
<Name>
    

<br><br></details>

<details>
<summary>Applying for fiktionsbescheinigung </summary>
The Fiktionsbescheinigung is a proof that you can stay in Germany without a residence permit. It‚Äôs just a piece of paper. You get it while you wait for another residence permit.
With a Fiktionsbescheinigung, you can:<br>
* Stay in Germany after your visa or residence permit expires<br>
* Continue your work, studies or self-employment.<br>
* In some cases, travel outside Germany<br>
How to get it? Ask for it. Call or email your VO. If you are calling then call in the early office hours.
<br><br></details>

<details>
<summary>Importance of German </summary>
(to be written in detail)
As with any country, native language is important if you want to find a job there. Even though it is relatively easy to find an IT job here which doesnt require German, Knowing German would help A LOT. Roughly 50% jobs (both student and full time jobs) require german and that is for CS. For other fields the percentage might be way higher. And German is almost always needed if you want to find a part time non technical odd job here. There are some instances where you wouldnt need it, for eg cases where you dont need to face the customer, but those jobs are rare and readily available. 
<br>
Also, Knowing German would generally help you a lot in daily life. For example socializing and etc.
<br>
University offers langauge courses for free. I would suggest taking them every semester.
After two years you will already be around B1 which is quite good and min required limit for passport as well.

### Accomodation and Living üèò
![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-10_Feb_24-blue)

<details>
<summary>Finding Accomodation</summary> 
    
    
- **Start applying/looking as soon as you can, preferably around 6 months before**. 
- **Before signing any contract and making any payment it is recommended that you request someone here to go visit the place on your behalf. If someone insists on making the payment without even visiting the place, it is a clear red flag. Try to convince them you will handover deposit and rent in person when you are here.**.


Most of the students live in dorms. There are two types of dorms. 
1) [University dorms](https://tl1host.eu/SWSB/#admission) (You can see the list of them and apply on that link)
2) [Private dorms](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/global/welcome-center/accommodation/private-dormitories.html)

- University dorms are usually the best option in terms of cost and living situation. But the waiting list is long, so apply as early in these as possible.
- Private dorms are *realatively* easier to get in as they have smaller waiting time. Since university dorms' applciation can take upto an year (as of writing this, Feb 2024).
- Refer to map A above to see where dorms are located in the city.
- For private dorms you will have to go to their respective website for their application. Some of them might only ask you to send an email to the manager there. That's ok. Just send them an email asking if there is a room available there.

<summary>Applying in Cusanushaus </summary>
    
![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-11_Feb_24-blue)
Cusanushaus is a private dorm in SB near the city center. There are 3 different types of rooms in this dorm, whose details you can see on the website linked below. You can see dorm's exact location on the map linked in Life in Saarbrucken Section. To apply for this dorm follow this process.
1- Visit the official website: https://cusanustreff.de/
2- Explore the different rooms. The rooms are of three categories and each has two variants i.e. with and without a toilet inside.
3- Download the from the website and duly fill it. 
4- Send the form on the mentioned email and the landlord will put your name in the queue. 

Cusanushaus offers one of the most convenient and cheapest locations you'll find in the city center. There are three bus stations within 3 minutes of foot. 3 different grocery stores under 10 minutes on foot, one of which is just 2 minutes away. The view is amazing, you can see the Saar river right from your room's window (if you get a room on the roadside facing). The city center is under 5 minutes on foot, the main train station at around 8-10 minutes on foot.. you get the point. 
Rent starts at 290 euros for the smallest rooms without toilet, from there you add around 30 euros for everything you add on top.
Lastly, one of the main "issues" of such a dorm is the shared kitchen and shared washrooms (including toilets). The main kitchen, including the main fridge but tenants usually buy a small fridge for their room, is shared among the entire floor consisting around 12-15 tenants. According to the Pakistani tenants living there, its rather rare that you find the kitchen completely busy and you have to wait for your turn to cook, very few people actually cook but this can vary. There are two toilets and a dedicated shower area on each end of the hallway. These are shared among (roughly) 6-8 people. 
The cleaning of these shared spaces is handled by the cleaning staff. They clean the toilets, shower, kitchen and the hallway in the morning of every week day. 
    
If you are unsure about anything, feel free to reachout to any of the seniors already living there to clear out any confussion. 
</details>
<br><br>   
    
You can also look for Wohngemeinschaft (WG - *pronounced as WheyGhey*). WGs are shared apartments where you live with other apartment-mates. In this case you have a shared kitchen and bathroom among the apartment mates.
You can look for WGs on [WG-Gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de) or [Ebay Klein](https://www.kleinanzeigen.de/stadt/saarbruecken/) or [Immobilien Scout](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/).

<details>
<summary>Cold rent vs Warm rent </summary>
    
![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-10_Feb_24-blue)
Cold rent means that you pay basic rent for the residence and there are no extra costs included in your monthly payment. 
Warm rent means that your monthly payment includes the basic rent for the residence AND additional costs ‚Äì called Umlagen or Nebenkosten.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Suitable price of the the apartment </summary>
    
![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-16_March_24-blue)
Price of the dorms are fixed (unless its being sublet, then some ppl sublet for it cheaper or higher. ask in the PSA group for current prices.

For the WGs, It depends on several factors like size of the room, wg or studio apartment, area, facilities etc. 
As of writing this:
In the city, near the city center where most the WGs are available:
Studio apartment for around 500-600 warm rent is good. Only sbt dorm is cheaper where studio apartment is around 450.
For wg/share apartment: it depends on the number of ppl you are sharing it with. Most apartments here are for 3 ppl. Avg price would be around 350-450 depending on the size of the room and size of the overall apartment.

<details>
    
![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-7_Feb_24-blue)
<summary>When looking for a room online, what are the key points to look for?</summary>
Answer: Depends on your priorities. If you want to live in a outskirts of the city away from any noise then you might want to go for dudweiler. If you want to live in the city with the bus connections, shops and other social places nearby then you might prefer area near the city center.  Both sides have pros and cons.
  - Living in dudweiler will mean cheaper accomodation, peacefullness and if you live in a dorm there then many other Pakistanis. The university is also nearer. But at the same time it will mean you might have to walk upto 10 ish min every time you wanna take a bus to go to somewhere. 
  - Living near the city center will mean nearby shops (and also some fast food places that are open till late night), more places to socialize, nearby bus stops and the usual hustle bustle. But living near the city center might cost you more money as rent is higher (around 50-100 euros more per month atleast).

<summary>how to know which property will allow me to use it for city reg and bank opening?</summary>
Answer: Ask them. usually all the dorms and long-term sublets will allow that. If the property (or a room in a wg) can be on your name then you can do city reg on it. Note that it is possible that a dorm is sublet by a student for some small duration, in that case you cannot do city registeration on that place. So, Just ASK the landlord.

- Start applying/looking as soon as you can, preferably atleast 6+ months. <br>
- If the time is short between you getting admission, and you coming here, I would suggest to defer your admission.<br>
- If the uni is forcing you to come regardless of you having done enrollment or not allowing to defer, ask for extensions. I'm sure they would understand if you say you have no place to live. Going to classes is generally not mandatory here anyway so missing a lecture or 2 in situations like these would not be the end of the world for either university or you.<br>
If you've honestly done all of the above and still you "Have" to be here because of maybe uni or something. Then yes. Ask in the group from seniors if anyone would be kind to host you(or find a temp private sublet maybe). Please remember, many seniors here are also students, maybe a year or so ahead of you but still students. It's hard as is to manage their day to day affairs, so if they are agreeing to host you, it's their generosity and should never be taken for granted.

<summary>For CS, Are the courses practical to our field job in future or are they theoretical and very research oriented? Is the degree hectic like is it easy to manage a part time job?</summary>
Answer: The courses in MS CS are optional meaning nothing is a must to take. You have just have to fill in credits of some categories. In those categories multiple courses are offered each semester and you are free to take any.

Because of this freedom the work load, difficulty and practicality of courses is totally custom and depends upon you i.e what courses you take. You can pick out the most difficult courses and have a hellish time or you can pick out your interest ones or relatively straight forward ones and it becomes manageable
Overall i would say the courses quality is good here. It's not going to be easy pickings, you'll have to put in some effort but your course selection really matters.

<summary>How to register for courses?</summary>
Answer: Its mainly done through LSF. Its link is attached at the content overview -> external links section.  There is a course description for each course or an external link to it (if there is not then wait for it, if the time is getting very close like 1-2 weeks and there is no information then email the prof or ask the seniors).
Note that this registeration only enables you to take the classes for that couses. To be able to sit in the exam for the course, you will have to register seperately. That registeration open 3-4 weeks before the exam and will be announced by the instructor in the class.

<summary>How to transfer enrollment fees from Pakistan</summary>
Answer: You can pay using wise or any german bank if you have those accounts. Or you can ask someone here in PSA if they can transfer the amount on your behalf and you can maybe send them money in their pakistani account (ppl who are travelling to pakistan sometimes need money in their pak account so they want to transfer euros to pkr ).
If neither is the case then you can do it from bank via FTT in Pakistan. It takes around a week to get the fees transfered (to get the swift details, it might take a bit longer to be shown on the portal).

<summary>Computer Science / Informatika </summary> 
    
Computer Science dept is one of the biggest department in UdS. 
You can find more information [here](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/study/programmes/bachelor/computer-science.html), including the information about the deadlines and everything. As of writing this, the GPA requirement for this dept is 3.
The Course specific requirements are as follows:

| Course Type      | Required Credits                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Core             | 27  (each course is 9 cp)         |
| Advance          | 27  (each course is usually 6 cp) |
| Seminar          | 7   (each seminar is 7 cp)        |
| Master Seminar   | 12                                |
| Thesis           | 30                                |
| Ungraded         | 17  (you can put core adv or seminar or language course in it)|
| ------           | --------                          |
| *Thesis - total* | 42                                |
| *Courses-total*  | 78                                |
| ------           | --------                          |
| *Total*          | 120                               |

So, you need to do 3 core courses and around 5-6 adv courses.
You can put any course in the ungraded course. For example if you are not happy with the grade in a course, just put it in the ungraded section.
You can pick these in any order, there is no restriction on the order you clear these.

This LST department is a dept focused on NLP and linguistics. Combining computer side of the linguistics. You can find more details about the dept [here](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html). There isnt any specific GPA requirement for admission but you must have some background in NLP or Linguistics. It is a small but very international and fun department. As of writing this, there are only 2 Pakistani students in the department including the original author of this document (Umer). I would highly recommend joining this department if you are interested in NLP or Linguistics. There are also many student working opportunities within the dept in various research groups. 
The course requirements are as follow:
    
| Course Type                    | Required Credits                  |

### Jobs Advice üè¢
![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-12_Jul_24-blue)


<details>
<summary>Technical jobs during studies</summary> 

we can divide technical jobs into 2 categories:
Werkstudent in a company,
Hiwi, which is std researcher etc related job in uni
    
werkstd in a company: these are sometimes more difficult to get, might require referal at time, but also usually pays well esp if its not a saarbr√ºcken based company. It can require german sometimes depending on the field for e.g security jobs even student ones require german at many instances.

Hiwi: These you get through professors so if you take a course from a prof. you score good in it so you can ask that prof for any open poisitions. But that is alao not always necessary sometimes just a good acdemic record or maybe even previous working exp helps you in getting one. This usally pays in b/w work student and odd jobs.
    
There are many research groups in each department in the university. And it is rather easier to find a job here. Especially if you are from a CS background and already have experience. 
<br><br>
You can contact the professors or PHD students in research groups and ask if they have any open position. For this you can go to your professor after the class or just go to your dept website and see which groups are there and then contact them via email. There are 2 main research centers for CS affiliated with UdS. They are DFKI and MPI. You can go to their respective sites and figure out which group you want to apply in. Then get the professors' or PHD students' email and then write a short 5-6 line introduction asking for an open position. 
<br><br>
</details>

<details>
<summary>Odd jobs during studies</summary> 
There are part time jobs available but most of them require German language. Especially if its a customer facing job. Non customer facing jobs ofc dont req German language proficiency.
There are opportunities to work in retails stores, restaurant, bakeries, or warehouses(but warehouse work is rare here, very few ppl have worked there)
In any case, it will always learning German as it will open far more opportunities specially in odd jobs

### General FAQs
All the questions which can not be put in specific category come here.
<details>
    
![written-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/last_updated_on-16_March_24-blue)

<summary>Is it okay to arrive after the "last date to arrive" ?</summary>
While it's certainly ok to arrive late. Here educatiom system will not force you to be punctual and take classes(no attendance etc) so you have to be self disciplined and hence we won't recommend being very chill about stuff. 
Also, moving abroad and living alone for the first time takes some time to get used to. So if you arrive late then it might get hectic for you to manage classes and getting used to here.
Its suggested to arrive before the classes start so you get settled here before the 'magic' starts.

### General Tips
All the helpful tips which can not be put in specific category come here.


- Download **DB** and **saarfahrplan** app. DB is for travel between cities (intercity). Saarfahrplan is for travel within saarbrucken (intra city). Always check for bus/train platform numbers, if there is one.
- For Frankfurt to Saarbr√ºcken, take the train from any station on **Frankfurt Airport** starting with **Frankfurt(M)Flughafen**  to **Saarbr√ºcken Hbf**.
- To access the block amount, you need a bank. And to open a bank account, you need **City registration**. So, do City Registration -> Bank Account -> Get Sim. Although, you can get a prepaid sim on your passport earlier.
- Suggested bank = Sparkasse. Suggested sim = O2. O2 requires city registration though. So when you first come here, you can buy Aldi sim from any Aldi store (ALdi is a groccery store), and then you can use it till you buy O2.
- Get your student cards delivered to someone before you arrive here so you get to travel for free (free within Saarland) as soon as you are here. If you don't have anyone to deliver your card to, msg in the PSA group.
- If you don't know german then get used to using google translate (for text) and Google lens/Google application (for image translation). Also, use browser in-built translators to translate the websites.
- University has a **[pinboard](https://www.stw-saarland.de/de/Kommunikation/Pinwand)** which has several things posted there, ranging from apartments to jobs.
- **[Ebay Klein](https://www.ebay-kleinanzeigen.de)** is a website like OLX. Pretty much has everything listed there. Some people even sell items for free (the last option in the category list). Price is usually already good so you don't have to bargain too much.
- Please **DO NOT** use **TORRENT** here. Torrents are very actively monitored here, not only you''ll be charged with a very very hefty fine to say the least. But also have to hire lawyers, go through hassles of legal stuff and what not. Please delete all torrent softwares and everything related to it from your computers. I know that it feels kinda repercussion free in pk, but it's not the case here, and people who have gone through it here can vouch for it as well

### About

This wiki began as a PSA student effort of 2024 by Umer, inspired by [Aria](https://hackmd.io/@ariabee)'s similar effort for the dept of LST. Hoping to serve this as one-central hub for answering all questions by new incomng students. 
 

For questions related to this operation in general: ... *(for now, ask Umer, but perhaps in the future PSA management will be managing it)*


If this becomes something and turns out to be actually useful then yaay. otherwise atleast I learnt a new tool.
